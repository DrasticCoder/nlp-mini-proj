# Education Online Course Categorization Project

## Course: Natural Language Processing (NLP) - Semester 6, Pillai College of Engineering

## Project Overview

This project is part of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) course for Semester 6 students at Pillai College of Engineering. The focus is on developing a system to classify online courses into predefined subjects such as Programming, Business, and Humanities. By leveraging various Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Language Models, the project aims to enhance navigation and discovery for students on e-learning platforms. The process involves text preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluating the models for their effectiveness in categorizing course content.
